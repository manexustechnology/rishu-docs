## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Rishu** (“we,” “us,” or “our”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use our mobile application (“App”).

## 2. Information We Collect

### 📦 Wallet Addresses & On‑Chain Data

When you connect your Web3 wallet, we record your public address and on‑chain transactions necessary to power the App’s features.

### 📧 Contact Information

If you choose to sign up for newsletters or support, we may collect your email address.

### 📊 Usage Analytics

We use anonymized analytics (e.g., device type, app performance, feature usage) to improve functionality. No personally identifiable data is linked to your wallet or email.

### 💬 Optional Feedback

Any feedback or bug reports you submit (including screenshots) are stored solely to help us enhance the App.

## 4. Sharing & Disclosure

- We **never sell or rent** your personal data.
- We may share **aggregated, non‑identifiable analytics** with third‑party providers (e.g., analytics services) under strict confidentiality.
- We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.

## 5. Data Security

We implement industry‑standard measures (encryption, secure servers) to safeguard your data. However, as a decentralized application, transactions on public blockchains are inherently transparent.

We will always post updates and notifications of any policy changes or security advisories on our official social channels.

Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.
